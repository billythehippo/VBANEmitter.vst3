# VBANEmitter.vst3
VBAN Emitter VST3 plugin

This is a simple cross-platform VBAN Emitter JUCE based VST3 plugin

It has been tested only on Linux but we all know about JUCE

To build it on Linux just clone this repo, go to Builds/LinuxMakeFile, open terminal there and type "make"
It will be places to ~/vst3, just move it to directory what you want (if you want).

To build it on/for other platforms just ask GPT how to build basic JUCE project.

When using this plugin you have to set it up manually, but it is just 0.1 version...
